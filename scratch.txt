Improvement areas for semantic-navigator
=========================================

FIXED in comprehensive remediation commit:
- [x] prog = "facets" → "semantic-navigator"
- [x] Unused import: from itertools import chain
- [x] max_chars can go negative with small n_ctx — now clamped to 1000
- [x] _estimate_model_size used wrong budget — now uses actual device memory + kv reserve
- [x] Empty aspect pool hangs forever — now raises SystemExit
- [x] Model loading crash on GPU not caught — now try/except with skip
- [x] Label cache not keyed by model — now uses model_identity hash
- [x] Added --flush-labels for label-only cache flush
- [x] Batch dispatch now concurrent via asyncio.gather
- [x] HF API query now shows feedback message

REMAINING (not yet addressed):
- complete() releases broken aspects back to pool
- count_llm_calls reads label cache from disk per-file (could use manifest)
- Embedding cache does per-file path.exists()
- list_devices() / detect_device_memory() GPU detection is Windows-only for GPU
- Tree UI has no search/filter for large repos
